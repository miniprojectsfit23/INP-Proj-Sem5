A Travel website with an illusion of login and register. Using jsonbin for storage and as a database of users. No backend. Only client side JavaScript

## For people who will talk about security

I know this website is not secure. The authentication code for jsonbin is visible in client side, One can just go to loggedin by going to loggedin.html. **I know**. What do you expect with a website that has no backend. The project constraints were that we coudn't use any backend. And i wanted to do something with Auth. So i made this. No need to say that it's insecure. **I know**
